I was able to get the TCP to send a file/image, just couldn't get UDP to do it.

BUILDING:
	run make

USAGE:
	TCP: start server with ./serverTCP path/to/file
	     start client, and it will download to the folder it's in

	UDP: start server with ./serverUDP
	     start client with ./clientUDP, and type a message, server will recieve and send a message back
